			<h2> What is it? </h2>
			<p>
			Often times we college students get waitlisted for classes we want.             To solve this, we trade classes with a friend. I got waitlisted for             Biology but don't care much for my Physics course. Bob, a friend of mine got waitlisted for Physics but got into a Biology course. I can give Bob my Physics course and he can give me his Biology course and we can both be happy. 
			<br></br>
			I doesn't have to end there. There can be trades of 3, 4, 5, ..., n people. Amy can give some course to Bob, Bob to Carl, Carl to Dave, Dave to Elenor and so on until some person Nancy gives a course to Bob.

			<h2>How You Can Use It</h2>



			<p>
			You can use this by logging in to your google account and then reporting pairs of trading. You give us a set of pairs of the form (class I have and am willing to trade, class I don't have or am waitlisted for) and we show you for each pair, all possible n-people trades. You then vote on these trades and if everyone agrees, a mass email is sent out.

			<h2>Underneath The Hood</h2>
			<p>
			In case you are interested, underneath the hood, we essentially solve the problem of finding all loops in a directed graph (or digraph).
