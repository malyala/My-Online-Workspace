				<p> 
				Hi there! You've reached Divesh's website. I hope you enjoy your stay. 
				The mints are on the house. Tip generously. 
				The bad jokes are complimentary.
				</p>

				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
				I am a Sophomore at <a href="www.haverford.edu" >Haverford College</a>. I am going to major in Computer Science and Mathematics. My resume and github page are linked to above.
				You can probably guess that I like Computer Science and Mathematics. I also enjoy chess, reading fiction (short stories especially), martial arts (I've studied Tae-Kwan-Do), 
				reading and writing poetry and a bunch of other stuff that I don't feel like listing. In terms of programming, I am fond of C, C++ and am intrigued by functional programming languages.
				Hence, I am looking into scheme and clojure while I am learning and coding with C++, C and Rust (I've only seen tutorials of Rust but it looks sublime).
				
				</p>
				<hr>
				
				
				
				<h3>What's Current</h3>
				<p>Soon, I will update this section with a list of Hackathons I am going to and my most current projects.
				I will also mention the competitive programming I engage in and my information on each of those sites.				
				</p>
				<hr>
				
				
				<h3>My Blogs</h3>
				<ul> 
				<li>
				
				<a href="https://diveshotwaniprogramming.blogspot.com/" >Divesh and Programming</a> is my blog about, you guessed it, programming. 
				
				</li>			
				<li>
				<a href="https://musingstarsound.blogspot.com/" >Musings, Stars, Sound</a> are things I discuss on my thought blog. I made this when I made my programming blog because why not.
				
				</li>				
				</ul>

				<h3>Best Programming Projects</h3>
				<p>
				For now, this matches my resume exactly so I will refer you to there.

				<h3>Miscellaneous Cool Things</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				One of the things I am fiercely passionate about is education. I am highly critical of educational institutions and educational methodologies and philosophies. 
				With one of my close friends, I made this awesome website called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/torchlightwwp/" >Torchlight</a> to remedy a major problem I saw at my school:
				unequal distribution of information about the college system leading to inequality in opportunity. As for it's success, since my friend and I have been busy with college, we have been
				unable to push it forward and spread it out. For now, only small circles in our high school are aware of the website. 
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
				My favorite novel is Catch-22. Here's an awesome quote.

				</li>
				<br>
				<blockquote>
				He was pinched perspiringly in the epistemological dilemma of the skeptic, unable to
accept solutions to problems he was unwilling to dismiss as unsolvable. He was never without
misery, and never without hope.
				</blockquote>
