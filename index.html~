                Hi there! You've reached Divesh's website. I hope you enjoy your stay. 
                The mints are on the house. Tip generously. 
                The bad jokes are complimentary.
                </p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                I am a Sophomore at <a href="http://www.haverford.edu" target="_blank" >Haverford College</a>. I am going to major in Computer Science and Mathematics. My resume and github page are linked to above.
                You can probably guess that I like Computer Science and Mathematics. I also enjoy chess, reading fiction (short stories especially), martial arts (I've studied Tae-Kwan-Do), 
                reading and writing poetry and a bunch of other stuff that I don't feel like listing. In terms of programming, I am fond of C, C++ and am intrigued by functional programming languages.
                I am currently learning Scala and Haskell. I am interested in eventually learning some Scheme, Clojure, and Rust.

                </p>

                <h3>What's Current</h3>
                <p>Soon, I will update this section with a list of Hackathons I am going to and my most current projects.
                I will also mention the competitive programming I engage in and my information on each of those sites.
                Update: I am planning on going to 4-5 Hackathons and am on some competitive programming sites, but am still settling in.
                This will be updated soon.				
                </p>

                        <a href="https://diveshotwaniprogramming.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" >Divesh and Programming</a> is my blog about, you guessed it, programming.

                        <a href="https://musingstarsound.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Musings, Stars, Sound</a> are things I discuss on my thought blog. I made this when I made my programming blog because why not.

                <h3>Best Programming Projects</h3>
                <p>
                I have a few Hackathon projects that can be found on my resume. However, I did not take major roles in those projects. 
                I do have, however a few small to medium sized projects on my github: 
					<ul>
					<li> I've made a repl for the simple programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" > BrainF</a> in C</li>
					<li> I have implemented some generic data structures in C including binary search trees, heaps and hash tables.</li>
					<li> In python, I have implemented
						<ul>
						<li>the game hangman</li>
						<li>a tool to help college students schedule classes</li>
						<li>a compiler for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" > BrainF</a></li>
						<li>a full example of RSA encryption and tools to help one set up their own RSA system</li>
						</ul>				
						and all of this is documented on my github.
					
					</li>
					<li> Of course, I have a lot more smaller projects and problems I've worked on.</li>
					
					</ul>

                <h3>Miscellaneous Cool Things</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        One of the things I am fiercely passionate about is education. I am highly critical of educational institutions and educational methodologies and philosophies. 
                        With one of my close friends, I made this awesome website called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/torchlightwwp/" target="_blank">Torchlight</a> to remedy a major problem I saw at my school:
                        unequal distribution of information about the college system leading to inequality in opportunity. As for it's success, since my friend and I have been busy with college, we have been
                        unable to push it forward and spread it out. For now, only small circles in our high school are aware of the website.

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        My favorite novel is Catch-22. Here's an awesome quote.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        He was pinched perspiringly in the epistemological dilemma of the skeptic, unable to
                        accept solutions to problems he was unwilling to dismiss as unsolvable. He was never without
                        misery, and never without hope.
                    </blockquote>
                    <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>
                    About This Website				
                </h3>
                <p>
                All the code for this website is readily available on the gh-pages branch of my github repository linked to above.
                Note: I did not use any templates because I think that's too easy. All the code for this site is code that I understand (and I did have help from stackoverflow, of course).
